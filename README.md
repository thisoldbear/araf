# Araf

A site to collate and curate routes conjured / frequented by [Araf.cc](http://araf.cc) and friends.

https://arafcc.vercel.app/

## Tech

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) services.

## Getting Started

Add a new `.env` file and add your variables. See `env.example` for some you'll need.

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Features
